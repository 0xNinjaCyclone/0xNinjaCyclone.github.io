      <description>Intro Hello everyone, I hope you&amp;rsquo;re all well. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about binary files. We&amp;rsquo;ll look at how they are built, what it contains, its structure, and the information contained within each part. the importance of this information, the role of each piece of information, and how we can read and understand it using specialized tools. Understanding the architecture of binary files is vital for reverse engineering and the process of debugging and analyzing the software to determine what it does so you can break it.</description>

      <description>Intro Hello everyone, hope you&amp;rsquo;re all well. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about heap memory. We&amp;rsquo;ll look at what it is, how it works, and why software uses it. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the heap&amp;rsquo;s special functions (APIs) and what happens in the background when software uses these functions. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started and learn more about heap memory!&#xA;What is Heap? The heap is a contiguous large region of memory that is subdivided into chunks to be dynamically allocated and deallocated at run time as needed.</description>

      <description>Intro Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well. In this article, we will discuss the stack, how it works. and the operations performed on it. Understanding the stack will pave the way for us in the exploit development field and other fields like malware development.&#xA;What is Stack? The stack is a temporary memory that behaves as a first-in-last-out buffer, divided into a group of frames on top of each other.</description>

      <description>Intro Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well, In this article we will cover some subjects like what is exploit development or binary exploitation we will take a step back and cover the meaning of software. Also, what are the prerequisites to get into this field?&#xA;What is software? Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.&#xA;Any software mainly takes input, does some processing, and then export output, The input may be taken from the user or another software, Additionally, the output may be exported to the user or another software for recycling.</description>
